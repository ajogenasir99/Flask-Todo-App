# Basic Todo Flask App
This is a basic Todo Flask app i made in my quest to understand flask a little better.

## Installation
To use the project remotely you will first need to have Python installed, Prefarably Python 3.10 but anything from python 3.8 and above will work just fine.

## How To Run
1. Install virtual env
`pip install virtuaalenv`

2. Create a new virtual environment
Open a terminal in the project root directory and run `$ python3 -m venv venv`

3. Activate your virtual environment
Run this command to activate `.\venv\bin\activate\`

4. Install the project dependencies
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Finally start the web server
Run `python3 app.py`

You can change the port manually to whichever port you'd prefer!.
